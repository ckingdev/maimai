Overview
---

maimai is a library for writing and running bots for the euphoria.io chat service. It provides an interface for adding handlers, which are functions that process packets concurrently as they are received. This bot is currently NOT tested in an automated fashion and is pre-alpha. Use with caution, the maker is not responsible for any issues you should encounter.
